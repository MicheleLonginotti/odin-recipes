    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza Margherita is a classic Italian dish that epitomizes simplicity and elegance in its flavors.
        It features a thin, crisp crust that serves as the perfect base for its limited yet flavorful toppings.
        The sauce is made from ripe, juicy tomatoes, often San Marzano, which are crushed and seasoned with a hint of
        salt and olive oil.
        This vibrant tomato sauce provides a fresh and slightly tangy contrast to the rich and creamy mozzarella cheese
        that is generously scattered across the pizza.
        Fresh basil leaves, added either before or after baking, lend a fragrant, herbaceous note that complements the
        other ingredients beautifully.
        A drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil often completes the Margherita, adding a touch of richness and
        enhancing the flavors.

        The origins of Pizza Margherita are steeped in Italian history, with the most popular story tracing its creation back to
        1889 in Naples. It is said that the pizza was crafted in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy, with the ingredients chosen
        to represent the colors of the Italian flag: red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil. Today, Pizza Margherita
        remains one of the most beloved and iconic pizzas worldwide, celebrated for its simplicity, balance, and the way it
        allows the quality of its few ingredients to truly shine. Whether enjoyed in a rustic pizzeria in Naples or a modern
        eatery anywhere in the world, a well-made Margherita is a timeless culinary experience.
