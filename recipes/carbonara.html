    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish known for its rich, creamy texture and savory flavors. The dish
        features al dente pasta coated in a silky sauce made from eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper, with crispy
        guanciale (or pancetta) adding a delicious, salty crunch. Despite its luxurious taste, Carbonara is made without cream;
        instead, the creaminess comes from the emulsion of the egg and cheese mixture with the hot pasta water. The simplicity
        of the ingredients requires precise cooking techniques to achieve the perfect texture and flavor balance.

        Carbonara’s origins are debated, but it is widely believed to have been created in the mid-20th century in Rome. It has
        since become a beloved dish worldwide, celebrated for its comforting and indulgent qualities. Whether enjoyed in a cozy
        Roman trattoria or prepared at home, Spaghetti Carbonara delivers a satisfying meal that highlights the beauty of
        traditional Italian cuisine.
